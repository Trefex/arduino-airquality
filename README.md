arduino-airquality
==================

In this project, we are building an Arduino Fio based platform to measure air quality (carbon monoxide and dust levels) and also tracking location using a GPS sensor.

We currently have multiple components working correctly with the Arduino Fio:

- [x] GPS sensor - Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout v3 and the OpenLog
- [x] Dust sensor - Sharp Optical Dust Sensor
- [x] Humidity and temperature sensor - SHT10 by sensiron/DFRobot
- [ ] Carbon monoxide sensor - Parallax CO sensor (in progress)

We are working on combining them all into a nice light package.
